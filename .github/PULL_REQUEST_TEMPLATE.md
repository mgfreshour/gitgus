## Reviewers

_**The reviewer is as responsible as the author for making sure code ships free of defects and is maintainable in the future.**_ 

_**An approval on a PR is a full approval to merge and release into production.**_

By approving this review you are confirming that...

- [ ] You believe that the branch is ready for deployment into production. This means:

  1. You thoroughly read and understood the code and how it relates to the functional and business requirements
  2. You ran tests locally or verified in Jenkins as appropriate
  3. You manually tested functionality and UI screens directly and indirectly impacted as appropriate
  4. You believe the number and quality of tests is sufficient to ensure that changes can be made later without risk of unintentionally breaking functionality
  5. You found the code coherent and ready for future use

- [ ] Either a security review was not required or has been requested with the `evergage/security-review` and completed

You should only issue an approval if all of the above are true. Use rejections or comments for any other feedback. If a security tag has been added two approvals are required, with at least one from a security reviewer.
