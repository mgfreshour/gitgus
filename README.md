## Install for use
Highly recommend using pipx over pip: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/ `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
If you don't want to hack on it and just want to use it, you can install it with pipx.  
This will install it in a virtual environment and add it to your path.  
You can then run `gitgus` from anywhere.

```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/mgfreshour/gitgus
```

## Install for development 
```shell
brew install sfdx
pipx install poetry
make 
```
